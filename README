What is hdfuse5?
----------------

hdf5use is a filesystem in userspace to explore hierarchical data files 

This software uses fusepy available from http://code.google.com/p/fusepy/
It provides a simple python interface to FUSE and MacFUSE in a single file.
fusepy is under the BSD License so I could include it for convience.
